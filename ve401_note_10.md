### Comparing Two Means - A Point Estimator

We have two populations with different means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, the goal is to estimate the difference $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ by taking a sample from each population in independent way.

Natural point estimator: $\hat{\mu_1 - \mu_2} := \hat {\mu_1} - \hat{\mu_2} = \overline X_1 - \overline X_2$
