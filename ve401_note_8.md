# Introduction to Statistical Method

## Hypothesis Testing

A second major statistical method for gaining information on a probability.

The goal is to reject or fail to reject statements (hypotheses) based on statistical data.

### Hypothesis Definition

A statement about a population parameter called $\theta$. The hypothesis will compare $\theta$ to a null value donated $\theta_0$.

### Fisher's Null Hypothesis Test

This hypothesis will be donated by $H_0$ and is null hypothesis.

Three forms:

-   $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$
-   $H_0: \theta\leq \theta_0$
-   $H_0: \theta \geq \theta_0$

A hypothesis test is based on rejecting a hypothesis.

### P-Value for a One-Tailed Test

The test of a hypothesis of the form $H_0:\theta \leq \theta_0$ or $H_0: \theta \geq \theta_0$ is said to be one-tailed tests.



### Two-Tailed Test

If we are testing a hypothesis of the form $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$, we say we are performing a two-tailed test.
